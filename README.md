# ENG311
This repository contains the install files for the digital text analysis tools used in ENG 311, Spring 2018:  Digital Shakespeare

If you do not want to wait or cannot use the USB drives I will bring for installation, please download the install files using the instructions within these folders.  You do not have to install these outside of class, we will do this together during our first workshop.  If you feel confident and comfortable with installing these ahead of time, you are welcome to do so - please bring up concerns or issues when we meet for installation during class.

Inside the Tool_Install folder you will find one folder for each PC or Mac, open whichever best fits your needs, and click on the README.md file inside for instructions and links.
